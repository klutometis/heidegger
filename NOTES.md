## Vibe Translation of Being and Time - Project Evolution

### Initial Vision
- **Problem**: Current translations of Heidegger's *Being and Time* lack clarity; key terms like Vorhandenheit, Zuhandensein, Dasein could be rendered more accessibly
- **Opportunity**: LLMs enable cheap iteration on translation choices, can focus on interesting parts while outsourcing mechanical aspects
- **Goal**: Create more readable/listenable translation optimized for audiobook format

### Legal Considerations
- **German original** (*Sein und Zeit*, 1927): Under copyright until 2046 (70 years after Heidegger's death in 1976)
- **Existing English translations**: All under copyright (Macquarrie & Robinson 1962, Stambaugh 1996, etc.)
- **Viable approach**: Original translation directly from German source (not derivative of existing English translations)
- **Strategy**: Frame as fair use, non-commercial, with explicit risk acknowledgment in README

### Core Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Multi-Model, Multi-Style System
- **Rationale**: Different LLMs interpret philosophical concepts differently; want to capture this variation
- **Structure**: Support GPT, Claude, Gemini with version variants (4o, sonnet, 1.5, etc.)
- **Benefit**: Can compare how different models handle same philosophical concepts

#### 2. Cascading Configuration System
```
Root level: STYLE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, GLOSSARY.md (defaults)
├── Model level: gpt-4o/STYLE.md (model-specific overrides)
    ├── Style level: gpt-4o/poetic/STYLE.md (style-specific)
        ├── Modality level: gpt-4o/poetic/comic-book/STYLE.md
```
- **Composition rule**: Files cascade and merge from root → model → style → modality
- **Benefit**: Reusable abstractions, clean overrides, experimental branches

#### 3. File Type Separation
- **STYLE.md**: Voice, register, syntax rules, poetic constraints
- **CONVENTIONS.md**: Term mapping commitments ("always use X for Y")  
- **GLOSSARY.md**: Conceptual exploration, multiple renderings, permission to drift

### Translation Strategy Decisions

#### Terminology Approach
- **Initial stance**: Don't pre-decide all term mappings; let meaning emerge through iteration
- **Refinement**: Use placeholder terms initially (`{{Zuhandensein}}`), then auto-regloss previous chunks when decisions solidify
- **Advantage**: LLMs make retroactive refactoring trivial

#### Chunk Size Optimization
- **Rejected**: Sentence-level (too autistic, loses flow)
- **Rejected**: Chapter-level (too large, overwhelming)
- **Chosen**: Paragraph with rolling context windows
- **Context strategy**: Feed LLM last 1-2 translated paragraphs + last 1-2 German paragraphs + current paragraph
- **Rationale**: Preserves phenomenological rhythm while maintaining manageable scope

#### Semantic Drift as Feature
- **Decision**: Allow translation choices to evolve over time rather than lock early decisions
- **Contrast**: Human translators tend toward rigid consistency; we can embrace beneficial drift
- **Implementation**: Version control translation lineage, log evolution in notes

### Multi-Modal Extensions

#### Beyond Text
- **Comic book**: Visual panels showing tool breakdown, Dasein's moods
- **Music score**: Concepts as motifs, *Stimmung* as harmonic shifts
- **Audiobook**: Optimized for rhythm, cadence, spoken performance
- **Staged reading**: Multiple voices, tempo annotations
- **VR**: Enact philosophical scenarios (tool breakdown in virtual workbench)

#### Rendering Pipeline
- **Text**: Markdown → Pandoc → LaTeX → PDF (EB Garamond font)
- **Each modality**: Own driver/renderer consuming same semantic content
- **Modular**: `modality/comic.py`, `modality/audio.py`, etc.

### System Architecture

#### Core Components
1. **driver.py**: Master orchestrator
   - Parses hierarchy, composes configs
   - Routes translation requests
   - Deposits artifacts in correct locations

2. **composer.py**: Config cascade merger
   - Walks up directory tree combining STYLE/CONVENTIONS/GLOSSARY files
   - Handles overrides and composition rules

3. **chunker.py**: Discrete text preparation module
   - Physical chunking (paragraph boundaries)
   - Contextual framing (rolling windows)
   - Future: semantic chunking, embedding-based context retrieval

4. **translator.py**: Model router
   - Wraps OpenAI, Anthropic, Google APIs
   - Model-specific configuration (tokens, temperature, etc.)

5. **writer.py**: Artifact deposition
   - Saves to correct nested directory structure
   - Maintains logs and metadata

#### Pre-Processing Enhancements
- **Term extraction**: LLM pre-pass to identify salient Heideggerian concepts
- **Frequency analysis**: Semantic TF-IDF to find structurally important terms
- **Embedding clusters**: Group related philosophical concepts
- **Bootstrap glossary**: Seed translations with extracted terms

### Production Workflow

#### CLI Interface
```bash
python driver.py --model gpt-4o --style poetic --modality comic-book --chapter 01
```

#### Output Structure
```
translations/gpt-4o/poetic/comic-book/ch01/para01.md
out/being-and-time-gpt-4o_poetic_comic.pdf
logs/gpt-4o_poetic_comic.log
```

#### Remixability (Gould Vision)
- Anyone can fork, modify STYLE.md/CONVENTIONS.md
- Regenerate entire book with new model or approach
- Compare translation variants side-by-side
- Future: web interface for custom generation

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1**: Basic orchestrator + single model + paragraph chunking
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-model support + cascading configs  
3. **Phase 3**: Pre-processing pipeline + term extraction
4. **Phase 4**: Multi-modal rendering + beautiful print output
5. **Phase 5**: Web interface + full remixability

### Open Questions for Implementation
- Optimal context window size per model?
- How to handle very long philosophical arguments that span multiple paragraphs?
- Should we include original German in final output (copyright risk)?
- Automated quality assessment of translations?
- Integration with version control for translation evolution tracking?

This system essentially creates a **composable, multi-agent philosophy remix engine** that treats translation as collaborative meaning-making rather than mechanical conversion.

### Text Source Investigation & Preprocessing

#### Source File Exploration
Investigated multiple formats from Archive.org for *Sein und Zeit*:

- **EPUB (237.9M)**: Downloaded successfully but pandoc failed with `parseSpine` error. Manual extraction of HTML files worked but text quality was poor (~24% accuracy) with corrupted umlauts and special characters.

- **ABBYY OCR (14.4M compressed)**: Extracted to 214MB XML file containing detailed character positioning data:
  ```xml
  <charParams l="839" t="2083" r="865" b="2109" wordFirst="1" ...>D</charParams>
  ```
  High quality OCR data but would require custom parsing script to extract clean text.

- **PDF (2.6M)**: **Winner** - `pdftotext` extraction produced high-quality German text with proper umlauts preserved.

#### PDF Extraction Issues Identified

1. **Ancient Greek Corruption**: Introduction quotes from Plato's *Sophist* 244a become garbled:
   ```
   ::: dÁlon g¦r æj Ømei√j men taàta (t∂ pote boÚlese shma∂nein
   ```
   **Solution**: Manually correct from Perseus Digital Library clean texts.

2. **Page Break Sentence Splitting**: Sentences break mid-word across pages:
   ```
   ...ihre Wurzel
   
   3
   
   in der antiken Ontologie...
   ```
   **Solution**: Programmatic fix using regex to rejoin split sentences.

3. **Paragraph Structure**: Text lacks clear paragraph breaks except for section markers (`§ 2.`).
   **Strategy**: Use § markers as primary structural divisions, then identify natural paragraph boundaries within sections.

#### Alternative Option
Archive.org's plain `.txt` file is well-formatted and clean, but truncates around page 437. Could potentially:
- Use clean .txt for first ~400 pages
- Supplement remaining content from PDF extraction
- Maintain consistent preprocessing across both sources

#### Final Source Format Decision

After testing multiple extraction methods:

**DJVU Text (`sein_und_zeit_djvu.txt`)**:
- ✅ **Natural paragraph breaks preserved** - perfect for chunking strategy
- ✅ Clean German text with proper umlauts
- ✅ Section markers (§) intact
- ❌ **Truncated content** (incomplete)
- ❌ Still has page break sentence splits and corrupted Greek

**Calibre EPUB Conversion**:
- ✅ **Highest text quality** - no OCR artifacts, perfect German characters
- ✅ **Complete content** - no truncation
- ✅ **Structural markers preserved** - § sections and page numbers intact
- ❌ **No paragraph breaks** - all text runs together despite various conversion flags

**Calibre Conversion Attempts**:
```bash
# Basic conversion
ebook-convert sein_und_zeit.epub sein_und_zeit_epub.txt

# Attempted paragraph preservation (no effect)
ebook-convert sein_und_zeit.epub sein_und_zeit_epub.txt \
  --insert-blank-line --insert-blank-line-size=2

# Attempted markdown formatting (no effect)  
ebook-convert sein_und_zeit.epub sein_und_zeit_epub.txt \
  --max-line-length=80 --pretty-print --txt-output-formatting=markdown
```

**Final Decision: DJVU + Preprocessing**
- Initially considered Calibre EPUB conversion but switched to DJVU source
- DJVU has natural paragraph breaks already preserved (key advantage)
- Build `preprocess.py` to clean formatting artifacts rather than reconstruct structure
- Much simpler problem: artifact removal vs. paragraph detection

### DJVU Preprocessing Implementation

#### Initial Preprocessing Challenges Identified

**Core Issues in DJVU Text:**
1. **Page break text splits**: `ihre Wurzel\n\n3\n\nin der antiken` - sentences split across page boundaries
2. **Hyphenated word breaks**: `be-\n\n6\n\ndarf` - hyphenated words split at line breaks  
3. **Citations and footnotes**: Mixed inline and standalone formatting
4. **Greek text corruption**: OCR artifacts in philosophical quotations
5. **Standalone page numbers**: Isolated digits like `\n\n204\n\n` throughout text

#### Implementation Evolution

**Phase 1: Overly Specific Approach**
- Started with character class enumeration: `[a-zäöüßA-ZÄÖÜ.«»,;:!?]`
- Tried to enumerate every possible punctuation mark and character type
- Became unwieldy when encountering parentheses, quotation marks, etc.

**Phase 2: Simplified Regex Patterns**
- Realized enumeration was unnecessary - could use `.` to match any character
- Two-case approach:
  1. Hyphenated words: `(.)-\s*\n\n\d+\s*\n\n(.)` → join without space
  2. Everything else: `([^-])\s*\n\n\d+\s*\n\n(.)` → join with space

**Final Implementation:**
```python
def rejoin_split_text(text):
    # Case 1: Ends with hyphen - join without space
    text = re.sub(r'(.)-\s*\n\n\d+\s*\n\n(.)', r'\1\2', text)
    
    # Case 2: Doesn't end with hyphen - join with space
    text = re.sub(r'([^-])\s*\n\n\d+\s*\n\n(.)', r'\1 \2', text)
    
    return text
```

#### Preprocessing Pipeline Steps

**Current `preprocess.py` workflow:**
1. **`rejoin_split_text()`**: Fix page break artifacts
2. **`remove_standalone_page_numbers()`**: Clean isolated page markers
3. **`fix_hyphenation()`**: Remove OCR hyphenation characters (¬)
4. **`clean_whitespace()`**: Normalize spacing
5. **`mark_sections()`**: Convert § markers to markdown headings

**Results:**
- Input: 1,140,447 characters (raw DJVU)
- Output: ~1,111,000 characters (cleaned)
- Successfully rejoins split sentences and hyphenated words
- Preserves paragraph structure and citations

#### Footnote Normalization Decision

**Problem Discovered:**
- Footnotes had inconsistent formatting in source
- Some multi-line, some single-line
- Getting merged with following paragraphs after preprocessing

**Manual Solution:**
- User manually normalized all footnotes to consistent `\d .*` format
- Much cleaner than algorithmic edge case handling
- Example: `1 Aristoteles, Met. B 4, 1001 a 21.`

**Outstanding Issue:**
- Footnotes still getting merged with subsequent text
- Need to decide: keep inline, convert to endnotes, or remove entirely
- Decision pending based on audiobook readability goals

#### Next Steps for Preprocessing
- Resolve footnote handling strategy (inline vs endnotes vs removal)
- Manual cleanup of remaining Greek text corruption  
- Test preprocessing output with translation pipeline
- Consider structural markup for better chunking

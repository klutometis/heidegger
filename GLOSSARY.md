# Philosophical Glossary & Conceptual Notes

## Fundamental Concepts

### Dasein
- **Literal**: "Being-there" 
- **Conceptual weight**: The mode of being characteristic of humans; existence as fundamentally relational and temporal
- **Translation notes**: Preserve German term due to technical precision, but provide English equivalents contextually

### The Question of Being (Seinsfrage)
- **Context**: The fundamental question that guides all of *Being and Time*
- **Distinction**: Being vs. beings (Sein vs. Seiendes)
- **Translation approach**: Maintain capitalization hierarchy to preserve ontological difference

### Temporality (Zeitlichkeit)
- **Not**: Clock time or sequential duration
- **Rather**: The existential structure that makes time possible
- **Key insight**: Past, present, future are modes of care, not sequential moments

### Care (Sorge)
- **Structure**: Ahead-of-itself-Being-already-in-(the-world)-as-Being-alongside
- **Translation challenge**: Avoid psychological connotations; this is an ontological structure
- **Variants**: concern (Besorgen), solicitude (FÃ¼rsorge)

## Translation Flexibility

### Permission to Drift
- Allow translation choices to evolve as understanding deepens
- Context may demand different renderings of the same term
- Prioritize philosophical accuracy over rigid consistency
- Use version control to track evolution of key terms

### Experimental Renderings
- **Thrownness** vs **Being-thrown** for *Geworfenheit*
- **Projection** vs **Projecting** for *Entwurf*  
- **Falling** vs **Falling-prey** for *Verfallenheit*

## German Original

Jedes Fragen ist ein Suchen. Jedes Suchen hat seine vorgängige
Direktion aus dem Gesuchten her. Fragen ist erkennendes Suchen
des Seienden in seinem Daß- und Sosein. Das erkennende Suchen
kann zum »Untersuchen« werden als dem freilegenden Bestimmen dessen, wonach die Frage steht. Das Fragen hat als Fragen
nach... sein Gefragtes. Alles Fragen nach ... ist in irgendeiner
Weise Anfragen bei... Zum Fragen gehört außer dem Gefragten
ein Befragtes. In der untersuchenden, d. h. spezifisch theoretischen Frage soll das Gefragte bestimmt und zu Begriff gebracht
werden. Im Gefragten liegt dann als das eigentlich Intendierte das
Erfragte, das, wobei das Fragen ins Ziel kommt. Das Fragen
selbst hat als Verhalten eines Seienden, des Fragers, einen eigenen
Charakter des Seins. Ein Fragen kann vollzogen werden als
»Nur-so-hinfragen« oder als explizite Fragestellung. Das Eigentümliche dieser liegt darin, daß das Fragen sich zuvor nach all
den genannten konstitutiven Charakteren der Frage selbst durchsichtig wird.

## Four AI Translations

### GPT Translation

**English:**
Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking has its prior direction derived from that which is sought. Questioning is the cognitive seeking of beings in their being-there and being-what. This cognitive seeking can become an "investigation" as the uncovering determination of that which the question stands for. Questioning has as its object that which is questioned. All questioning regarding... is in some way an inquiry into... Besides the questioned, there is also an interrogated. In the examining, that is, specifically theoretical question, the questioned must be determined and brought into concept. In the questioned lies then, as the truly intended, the inquired, that which the questioning aims at. The questioning itself has, as the behavior of a being, the questioner, its own character of being. A questioning can be carried out as "just-asking" or as an explicit question. The peculiarity of this lies in the fact that questioning becomes transparent in light of all the aforementioned constitutive characters of the question itself.

**Translator's Notes:**
In this translation, I aimed to maintain Heidegger's phenomenological rhythm while ensuring clarity and accessibility. The term "Fragen" is translated as "questioning" to emphasize the active process of inquiry rather than a static noun. This aligns with Heidegger's focus on the dynamic nature of questioning as a seeking. The phrase "erkennendes Suchen" is rendered as "cognitive seeking" to capture the epistemological aspect of the inquiry, highlighting that questioning is not merely about asking but involves a deeper engagement with the nature of beings.

The distinction between the "questioned" and the "interrogated" is crucial, as it reflects Heidegger's emphasis on the relational aspect of questioning. The term "investigation" is used to convey the idea of a deeper exploration that goes beyond surface-level inquiry, aligning with the philosophical depth of Heidegger's analysis. 

I chose to translate "das Gefragte" as "that which is questioned" to maintain the focus on the object of inquiry, while "das Erfragte" is translated as "the inquired" to emphasize the intended outcome of the questioning process. This distinction is important in understanding the structure of Heidegger's argument.

The phrase "just-asking" captures the informal nature of some questioning, contrasting with the more formalized "explicit question." This reflects the spectrum of inquiry that Heidegger discusses, from casual to rigorous.

Overall, the translation seeks to preserve the philosophical nuances while ensuring that the text remains accessible to readers unfamiliar with Heidegger's dense terminology.

**Translation Uncertainties:**
- The term "just-asking" may not fully capture the nuance of "Nur-so-hinfragen"; alternatives could include "casual questioning" or "merely asking."
- The distinction between "questioned" and "interrogated" may require further clarification depending on the context in which they are used.

### CLAUDE Translation

**English:**
Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking has its prior direction from out of what is sought. Questioning is the knowing seeking of beings in their "that-ness" and "how-ness". The knowing seeking can become "investigating" as the uncovering determination of that which the question stands for. Questioning, as questioning after..., has its questioned. All questioning after... is in some way an inquiring with.... Beyond the questioned, questioning also involves something being questioned. In the investigating, that is, specifically theoretical question, the questioned is to be determined and brought to concept. Within the questioned lies, as what is actually intended, the sought-after, that toward which questioning arrives at its goal. Questioning itself, as the comportment of a being, the questioner, has its own character of being. A questioning can be carried out as a "mere-passing-query" or as an explicit formulation of the question. The peculiarity of the latter lies in the fact that questioning first becomes transparent to itself regarding all of these constitutive characteristics of questioning itself.

**Translator's Notes:**
This passage represents a quintessential Heideggerian phenomenological analysis of the structure of questioning itself. Several key philosophical moves are at work:

1. Ontological Approach: Heidegger is not merely describing questioning as an epistemological act, but as an ontological event - a mode of being that reveals something about the structure of Dasein's existence.

2. Key Terminological Choices:
- "Seeking" (Suchen) is translated to preserve the active, intentional nature of questioning
- "That-ness" and "how-ness" (Daß- und Sosein) attempt to capture the ontological dimensions of beings' existence
- "Comportment" (Verhalten) maintains the phenomenological sense of an active, engaged relationship

3. Philosophical Nuances:
- The passage emphasizes the directional and intentional nature of questioning
- There's a recursive quality to questioning - the ability to become transparent to its own structures
- The distinction between "mere-passing-query" and "explicit formulation" reveals different modes of ontological engagement

The translation aims to preserve Heidegger's phenomenological rhythm - the careful, almost meditative unpacking of a seemingly simple concept (questioning) to reveal its profound ontological complexity.

**Translation Uncertainties:**
- Daß-und Sosein
- Verhalten
- mere-passing-query

### GEMINI Translation

**English:**
Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking has its prior direction from what is sought. Questioning is a cognizing seeking of entities in their ‘that-it-is’ and ‘what-it-is’. This cognizing seeking can become ‘investigation’ as the disclosing determination of that to which the question pertains. Questioning, as questioning about..., has that which is questioned. All questioning about... is in some way an inquiry directed at... To questioning belongs, besides that which is questioned, that which is consulted. In the investigative, that is, specifically theoretical, question, that which is questioned is to be determined and conceptualized. In that which is questioned, then, lies that which is genuinely intended: the inquired-into, that whereby questioning reaches its goal. Questioning itself, as a comportment of an entity, the questioner, has its own character of Being. A questioning can be carried out as ‘mere-asking-around’ or as explicit questioning. The distinctive feature of the latter lies in the fact that questioning itself becomes transparent beforehand with regard to all the aforementioned constitutive characters of the question itself.

**Translator's Notes:**
This paragraph delves into the fundamental structure of questioning (Fragen) as a mode of Dasein's Being. I aimed to maintain Heidegger's precise distinctions while ensuring readability.

**Key Term Translations & Reasoning:**
*   **Fragen / Suchen**: Translated as 'questioning' and 'seeking' respectively. These are direct and clear.
*   **erkennendes Suchen**: Rendered as 'cognizing seeking'. 'Erkennend' implies a cognitive act of gaining knowledge, which 'cognizing' captures more precisely than 'knowing' in a philosophical context.
*   **Seienden in seinem Daß- und Sosein**: Translated as 'entities in their ‘that-it-is’ and ‘what-it-is’'. 'Seiendes' refers to particular beings or entities. The 'Daß-sein' (that-being) and 'Sosein' (so-being) are crucial Heideggerian distinctions referring to the fact of existence and the essence/nature of something, respectively. The hyphenated English forms preserve this directness.
*   **Untersuchen**: Kept in quotes as 'investigation' to reflect Heidegger's original use, suggesting a specific, rigorous form of seeking.
*   **freilegenden Bestimmen**: Translated as 'disclosing determination'. 'Freilegend' aligns with Heidegger's concept of 'Erschlossenheit' (disclosedness), emphasizing the act of uncovering or revealing. 'Bestimmen' means to determine or define.
*   **Gefragtes**: Translated as 'that which is questioned'. This refers to the *topic* or *subject matter* of the question.
*   **Befragtes**: Translated as 'that which is consulted'. This is distinct from 'Gefragtes'. 'Befragtes' refers to the *source* from which the answer is sought, the entity *being asked*. While 'interrogated' was considered, 'consulted' feels less aggressive and better captures the sense of seeking information from a source, aligning with the broader context of philosophical inquiry rather than a police interrogation.
*   **zu Begriff gebracht werden**: Translated as 'conceptualized'. This is a more natural and concise way to express 'to be brought to a concept'.
*   **Erfragte**: Translated as 'the inquired-into'. This term refers to the *result* or *goal* of the questioning, what is ascertained through the inquiry.
*   **Verhalten**: Translated as 'comportment'. This is a standard and accurate translation for Heidegger's use of the term, denoting a fundamental way of being or relating.
*   **Charakter des Seins**: Translated as 'character of Being'. This maintains the literal meaning and philosophical weight.
*   **Nur-so-hinfragen**: Translated as 'mere-asking-around'. This captures the casual, uncommitted nature of this type of questioning.
*   **explizite Fragestellung**: Translated as 'explicit questioning'.
*   **sich

### GROK Translation

**English:**
Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking has its prior direction derived from that which is sought. Questioning is a cognizing seeking of beings in their that-it-is and so-being. This cognizing seeking can become 'investigating' as the determining that lays bare that after which the question aims. Questioning, as questioning after..., has its that-which-is-asked. All questioning after ... is in some way an inquiring of.... To questioning belongs, besides the that-which-is-asked, a that-which-is-interrogated. In the investigating, that is, specifically theoretical question, the that-which-is-asked should be determined and brought to concept. In the that-which-is-asked lies then, as the actually intended, the that-which-is-to-be-found-out, that whereby the questioning reaches its goal. Questioning itself, as the behavior of a being, of the questioner, has its own character of Being. A questioning can be carried out as 'just asking along' or as an explicit posing of the question. The peculiarity of this lies in that questioning becomes transparent to itself beforehand with regard to all the named constitutive characters of the question itself.

**Translator's Notes:**
In translating this paragraph, I aimed to preserve Heidegger's rhythmic flow and argumentative cadence, breaking up long sentences only where necessary for clarity and speakability in an audiobook context. For key terms, I used 'Being' for 'Sein' to maintain its central philosophical weight, as per the glossary. 'Seienden' was rendered as 'beings' to denote entities in their existential state. 'Daß- und Sosein' was translated as 'that-it-is and so-being' to capture the existential (that it exists) and essential (how it is) aspects, aligning with Heidegger's phenomenological focus on the structure of beings. This choice reflects the broader theme of ontological inquiry in 'Being and Time,' where Heidegger distinguishes between mere existence and the manner of being. Challenges included rendering compound terms like 'Gefragtes' as 'that-which-is-asked,' 'Befragtes' as 'that-which-is-interrogated,' and 'Erfragte' as 'that-which-is-to-be-found-out,' which are awkward in English but necessary to convey the precise, phenomenological dimensions without over-simplifying. These translations make the logical structure more transparent while staying faithful to Heidegger's experiential descriptions. Contextually, this paragraph builds on the formal structure of the question of Being, emphasizing how questioning involves seeking and disclosure, connecting to themes of temporality and authenticity. I made interpretive decisions to optimize readability, such as using 'cognizing seeking' for 'erkennendes Suchen' to highlight the intellectual aspect, though this could evolve. Overall, I ensured the translation remains academically precise yet accessible, focusing on the argumentative integrity of the paragraph.

**Translation Uncertainties:**
- Translation of 'Daß- und Sosein' as 'that-it-is and so-being' – This captures the existential and modal aspects but might benefit from further refinement for clarity in English.
- Rendering of neologistic terms like 'Gefragtes' and 'Befragtes' – These were translated descriptively, but their full phenomenological nuance may require listener context to fully appreciate.

---

### GEMINI-2.5-FLASH's Analysis

**Verdict:** GEMINI Translation translation is best

**Philosophical Accuracy Scores:**
- GPT Translation: 7/10
- CLAUDE Translation: 8/10
- GEMINI Translation: 9/10
- GROK Translation: 6/10

**Reasoning:**
Gemini's translation stands out as the most philosophically sound and well-balanced. It consistently employs the most accurate and standard English equivalents for Heidegger's specific terminology, demonstrating a deep understanding of the philosophical distinctions being made. For instance, its translation of 'Daß- und Sosein' as '‘that-it-is’ and ‘what-it-is’' is exemplary, capturing both the existential and essential aspects precisely. Similarly, 'comportment' for 'Verhalten' is crucial for conveying Heidegger's concept of Dasein's way of being-in-the-world, which Gemini correctly identifies. Its choice of 'disclosing determination' for 'freilegenden Bestimmen' leverages the key Heideggerian concept of 'disclosure' (Erschlossenheit). Furthermore, Gemini's interpretive choice of 'that which is consulted' for 'ein Befragtes' is particularly astute, avoiding the problematic connotations of 'interrogated' while accurately reflecting the role of the 'Befragtes' as a source of information or insight in the questioning process. While other models had strengths (e.g., Claude's 'comportment' and 'that-ness/how-ness'), Gemini's overall consistency, precision, and nuanced interpretive choices across the entire passage make it superior. It manages to be highly accurate without sacrificing readability to the extent that Grok does with its overly literal approach.
